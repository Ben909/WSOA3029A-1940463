            <p> The purpose of this website is to express the reasons why data visualization is so important.
                It is much easier for people to understand data when they see it visually, then it is when we see it as a table of numbers.
                A well-crafted and thoughtful visualization of data allows people grasp information in a way that is more dynamic than most other forms of research.
                More than any other tool, it increases the speed at which we gain insight about data because it requires us to use both the logical
                and creative side of the human brain. Each type of visualization might also be used in a variety of research fields.
                Through this form of data, we are able to identify trends and outliners in much greater detail. It enables us to have conversations
                about the information we are presented. This makes it easier and faster for us get certain answers rather than having to write queries on a database.
