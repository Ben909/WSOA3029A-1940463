        <p>
            As per the assignment brief, we are required to produce some form of data visualization using an existing API.
            The graph below is facilitated by the open source library, <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/" target="_blank">Chart.js</a> to illustrate the statistical distribution of recovered
            Covid-19 patients across all eleven provinces of South-Africa. The concept for the chart is inspired by the times we life in.
            Amidst the pandemic, the current change in climate proves that more patients have recovered due to a lower chance for the
            virus to spread in warm weather temperatures. I therefore decided to create a chart which indicates which provinces had the 
            highest recovery rate. My idea was that this information could be used inform communities of strategies to combat the virus or 
            mitigate risk factors. Currently, the chart is not yet equipped with a ‘poll’ function to indicate individual recoveries from 
            various provinces in the country. For the purpose of this visualization, there are no databases where I can store this 
            information or keep it updated. Further development of this chart must be conducted within these considerations.
