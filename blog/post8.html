        <h1>Group discussion</h1>

        <p> Throughout the second semester, our WhatsApp group has revealed many interesting conversations regarding information and how 
            visualizations communicate theories or key areas of study. One of these readings suggests that data visualization is a matter of 
            life and death. Alberto Cairo reasons the modern use of data visualization is to expand knowledge to wider audiences and that 
            analyzing data firstly means we have to understand why it is important or relevant to collect certain types of data. His examples 
            showcase how century old visualizations have consequences for contemporary graphic designers. A popular diagram of the causes of 
            mortality during wars in the east can reveal to us the narratives needed to counteract similar circumstances in contemporary society. 
        </p>    
        <p> If we are to understand the stories behind graphs, we must urge readers to become actively involved in the narratives that 
            unfold when we provide insightful discoveries about certain topics. For example, the relationship between healthcare and the 
            practice of social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic. Once readers realize the importance of protective measures by 
            seeing specific timelines infront of them, they will recognize why these social barriers are so important. Without appreciating 
            the effectiveness of social distancing, it becomes difficult to comprehend the narrative of life and death which we are surround 
            by in present times.
