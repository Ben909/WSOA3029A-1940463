        <h1>Information is Beautiful</h1>

        <p> Visualizations are made beautiful when any kind of data, numbers, statistics or ideas are turned into graphics that anyone can 
            understand. When we visualize any form of information, we attempt to represent something in such a manner that it reveals a 
            powerful or impactful story about the events that surround us. Each day the press overwhelms us with the latest details and 
            figures that supposedly influences our future livelihood. But what do these numbers actually mean beyond the self-evident fact 
            that we cannot fully grasp or control them? 
        </p>    
        <p> Immediately by visualizing this information, we have a different kind of relationship to the numbers because we can literally 
            see them and more interestingly, we can start to see the connections and patterns between numbers that would otherwise be 
            scattered across multiple news reports. We have unconsciously become more design literate and more visually inclined to read and 
            relate information based on the conceptual shapes and colors made available by data visualizations. The multilingual capability of 
            data visualizations is revealed to us through the language of the eye which naturally detects patterns between shapes and colors, 
            combined with the language of the mind that helps us to identify ideas, numbers and concepts. They correspond and enhance each other 
            to speak two languages simultaneously. In doing so, visualizations redefine our perceptions of ideas and how we investigate them.
