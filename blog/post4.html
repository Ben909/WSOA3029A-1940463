        <h1>Data Ethics</h1>

        <p> The importance of accessibility cannot be underestimated when it comes internet browsing. 
            The majority of people will shy away from webpages which lack the aesthetic qualities to enhance user experience. 
            An all-inclusive webpage caters for the need of an entire audience, even people with disabilities. 
            Once an individual is comfortable with a website, it is likely that they will develop an expectation for other websites to be of the same quality they have previously experienced. 
            Accessibility ranges anywhere from being able to magnify images for elderly people to providing alternative communication to people with cognitive disabilities. 
            Businesses rely heavily on the use of easy access to information to optimize how they operate and interact with each other. 
        </p>    
        <p> Studies has also shown that a more accessible website will attract larger audiences, require less maintenance cost and achieve better search results (Abou-Zahra.2018). 
            Successful accessibility stems from several components working in tandem. 
            Web content refers any information that is made available by the website, for example images, texts, scripts, code, etc. 
            User agents looks at the software people can use to access web content, for example voice browsers or mobile phone browsers. 
            The final component involves authoring tools which enables people create their own web content. 
            This includes the various code editors, blogs and document conversion tools.
