        <h1>Exam Graph Reflection</h1>

        <p> When given the opportunity to visualize data, there are a few essential aspects to take in consideration. One must ensure that the 
            data conveys information in an unbiased and non-leading. This helps to mediate narratives to that the end user so that they can 
            better understand the situation or gain new insight. The goal is not necessarily to sway them one way or another. Before implementing 
            the visualization, it is important to understand the context of the data visualization. As a developer, I must therefore ask the 
            questions that pertain to the data represented. Firstly, I must identify the target audience. In this case the data is meant to reach 
            wider audiences and not only audiences from the top ten tested countries as depicted by the graph. It must help global parties to gain 
            knowledge about the value of consistent testing and to develop qualitative and quantitative methods of testing. When a communicable disease begins, 
            the ideal response is for public health officials to begin testing for it early. This leads to quick identification of cases and 
            treatments. Testing is important in the bigger picture on mitigation efforts and to help investigators characterize the prevalence, 
            contagiousness and spread of the virus.  
        </p>
        <p> After determining the desired audience, one must question the values they hold over the information they are presented. What do they 
            need to know and what can they do with the data? This helps to appropriate the visualization for further investigation. Data 
            driven document primarily focusses on drawing attention to the most relevant or important pieces of information. It is therefore 
            crucial to exclude any data that doesnâ€™t benefit the outcome of comparisons between data.
